# 📦 Node.js vs Flask Dependency Management

In **Node.js**, the `package-lock.json` file ensures consistent dependency versions across different environments. It locks the exact versions of the installed packages and their dependencies, preventing unexpected version mismatches.

## ✅ Equivalent in Flask

In **Python**, the equivalent of `package-lock.json` is the **`requirements.txt`** with pinned versions. However, Python also has more advanced tools like:

- **`pip freeze`** → Creates a `requirements.txt` with exact installed versions.

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

- **Pipenv** → Generates a **Pipfile** and **Pipfile.lock** (similar to `package-lock.json`).

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv lock
```

- **Poetry** → Uses **pyproject.toml** and **poetry.lock** for project dependencies and their locked versions.

```bash
poetry install
poetry lock
```

---

## ✅ When to Use Which?

- **requirements.txt** → Simple and effective for small projects or deployments.
- **Pipfile.lock** → Ideal for developers needing environment isolation and dependency management.
- **poetry.lock** → Best for larger projects requiring strict versioning and packaging.

---

## 🚀 **Option 1: Using Pipenv (`Pipfile.lock`)**

### 📥 Install Pipenv

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

### 🌱 Initialize the Project

```bash
pipenv install
```

- This will create:
  - **`Pipfile`** → Similar to `package.json`, it tracks dependencies.
  - **`Pipfile.lock`** → Similar to `package-lock.json`, it locks exact versions.

### 📦 Add Packages

```bash
# Install Flask and save it to Pipfile
pipenv install Flask

# Install dev dependencies
pipenv install pytest --dev
```

### ⚙️ Run the App

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
pipenv shell

# Run the app
python run.py
```

---

## 🚀 **Option 2: Using Poetry (`poetry.lock`)**

### 📥 Install Poetry

```bash
pip install poetry
```

### 🌱 Initialize the Project

```bash
poetry init
```

- Follow the prompts to set project name, version, and dependencies.

### 📦 Add Packages

```bash
# Install Flask
poetry add Flask

# Install dev dependencies
poetry add --dev pytest
```

- This will create:
  - **`pyproject.toml`** → Similar to `Pipfile`, tracks project dependencies and settings.
  - **`poetry.lock`** → Similar to `Pipfile.lock`, ensures reproducible builds.

### ⚙️ Run the App

```bash
# Install all dependencies
poetry install

# Run the app
poetry run python run.py
```

---

## 🎯 **Conclusion**

- **Use Pipenv** → For simpler projects or when working with isolated environments.
- **Use Poetry** → For production-ready applications and complex projects.
- **Use requirements.txt** → For lightweight, straightforward dependency management.

Choose the right tool based on your project's needs! 😊
